Welcome to TerminalHacker!

This basic Unity game is simple to play!

You can play my version directly in your browser here: https://lukemccann.github.io/TerminalHacker/

To begin the game you will first be asked to choose a wireless network based on difficulty.

A page will then load asking you to enter a password, the hint being an anagram of the password.

To return to the main menu at any time simply type menu in the input

commands - 007 (in main menu for easter egg)
